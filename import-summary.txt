ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => BLEDemo/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => BLEDemo/src/main/assets
* libs/blelib.jar => BLEDemo/libs/blelib.jar
* libs/ksoap2-android-assembly-3.3.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar => BLEDemo/libs/ksoap2-android-assembly-3.3.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
* lint.xml => BLEDemo/lint.xml
* res/ => BLEDemo/src/main/res/
* src/ => BLEDemo/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
